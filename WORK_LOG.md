| April 3 |   240-3pm   | I tried to understand the problem set during class time. Thought about potentially sorting snakes and ladders 2d arrays for optimizations as well as returning -1 early by checking if the last 6 spots are snakes. Thought about edge cases like if the board is 1, just return 0.                                                       |
| April 4 | 1030-1040am | Talked to Mr. Blick during tutorial to better understand the problem. Received feedback that sorted lists --> binary search can be an optimization, but I should focus more on HOW to actually solve the problem. Benchmark could be BFS with optimizations including a 2d visited array and array storing min moves to get to each spot. |
| April 4 |   9-10pm    | A greedy approach could be always moving 6 or to nearest ladder. Could use a dictionary for all the moves, since snakes/ladders are all moves with a starting and ending point. Decided to try to implement BFS first and use an array mapping all moves from starting to ending points. The classic BFS implementation worked.           |
